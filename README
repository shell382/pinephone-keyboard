FOSS firmware for pinephone keyboard
====================================

Features:

- Dual firmware architecture: stock firmware + optional user firmware.
- Stock firmware implements the full functionality of the keyboard.
  - Stock firmware is layout independent, it reports the raw status
    of the whole keyboard matrix.
  - Key maps and combinations can be arbitrarily changed in the keyboard
    driver without re-flashing the firmware.
  - Stock firmware should be sufficient for most users who will not want
    to do HW modifications to their keyboard to add more peripherals to
    the keyboard MCU.
  - Power efficient implementation using power-down feature of the MCU
    to save power as much as possible. (currently: 9 mW when idle, 20mW
    in active scanning mode - with at least one key pressed)
- Stock firmware is flashed in factory and allows flashing user firmware
  from the pinephone itself over I2C interface.
- User firmware can be used either for updates or for customizations
  (SW support for HW modifications of the keyboard)
- USB stack and tools for stock firmware flashing using ELAN's original
  bootloader to ease development of the stock firmware.
- Self-testing features to quickly test for issues with the keyboard matrix.
- Fully based on FOSS software, with no dependencies. You only need
  sdcc 4.1+ to build the firmware.
